## Introduction and Problem
The Global Superstore dataset contains comprehensive sales data from a fictional retail company operating globally. It includes information on various aspects of the business, such as sales transactions, customer demographics, product categories, and regional data. The dataset is typically used to analyze sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency, providing insights into how the company can improve its strategies and decision-making processes.

Some problem need to evaluate from the data to elevate the store:

- How can we evaluate the overall sales and profit metrics to assess the current business performance of Global Superstore?
- What are the trends and patterns in sales and revenue over time, and how do seasonal factors influence these metrics at Global Superstore?
- How does sales performance vary across different product categories, and what strategies can be implemented to boost sales in underperforming categories?
- How do sales patterns differ across various customer demographics, and what insights can be leveraged to personalize marketing strategies and increase customer engagement?
- How can we accurately predict future sales based on historical data trends, and what insights can be derived to support strategic planning and decision-making at Global Superstore?
